# Getting Started 


## A simple example

The following `index.html` shows a complete webxdc app, with an input field shown on all peers. Data submitted from the input is delivered to all members of the chat.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <script src="webxdc.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <input id="input" type="text"/>
    <a href="" onclick="sendMsg(); return false;">Send</a>
    <p id="output"></p>
    <script>
      function sendMsg() {
        msg = document.getElementById("input").value;
        webxdc.sendUpdate({payload: msg}, 'Someone typed "'+msg+'".');
      }
    
      function receiveUpdate(update) {
        document.getElementById('output').innerHTML += update.payload + "<br>";
      }
      webxdc.setUpdateListener(receiveUpdate, 0);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

To package the app as a `.xdc` file, zip the directory containing the `index.html`:

```shell
zip -9 --recurse-paths "myapp.xdc" PATH_TO_DIR
```

Now it's possible to share the `myapp.xdc` file in any chat: recipients can hit "Start" to begin using the app to enter text in this input field and send updates to each other. 

To simulate multiple chat participants in the browser, try [Hello](https://github.com/webxdc/hello) as a minimal example; it includes everything needed to run the app and requires no build systems.
